# Supermarket Product Shelving Simulation. (Real-Time Application)
Supervised by Prof. Hanna Bullata.
This project aims to create a dynamic simulation of supermarket shelving processes, integrating both multi-processing and multi-threading to model the workflow of shelving teams. The simulation parameters, including the number of products (p), their shelf and storage quantities (ami), team compositions, and customer behaviors, are all user-defined. The system automatically replenishes shelf stock from storage when levels dip below a set threshold, utilizing randomly selected team managers and their teams for the task. Customer arrivals and product choices are simulated to mimic real-world variability. The simulation provides valuable insights into efficient shelving strategies and customer service optimization, concluding either when stock depletes or a set time elapses. Implemented in a Linux environment, this project combines programming skills with a graphical representation of the supermarket layout and activities, using the OpenGL library for visualization.
